				<p>Myanmar reported the death of another COVID-19 patient on Saturday, taking the country’s coronavirus death toll to five while the number of infected people in the country has risen to 94.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Yangon is the hardest hit region, with 76 infections and four deaths reported as of Saturday morning. The regional government on Friday ordered a nighttime curfew effective Saturday.</p>
				<br>
				<p>A 78-year-old man who had been in intensive care at Yangon’s Waibargi Infectious Diseases Hospital since testing positive for COVID-19 on Friday died on Saturday morning, the Myanmar Ministry of Health and Sports (MOHS) said.</p>
				<br>
				<p>The man, who also suffered from hypertension and diabetes, was initially admitted to Yangon’s Insein Hospital on Wednesday and kept in isolation as a suspected COVID-19 patient, as he was showing symptoms of the disease.</p>
				<br>
				<p>The MOHS said on Saturday the patient died due to severe pneumonia caused by the coronavirus in combination with his two underlying diseases.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Lawmaker U Yan Shin from Yangon’s Mayangone Township told The Irrawaddy on Saturday the patient had close contact with COVID-19 patients from the same township who tested positive for the coronavirus on Wednesday.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Myanmar reported its first death from COVID-19 on March 31. The 69-year-old man had been undergoing treatment for stage-4 cancer and died of multiple causes including the coronavirus.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Two more COVID-19 patients died on April 8—a 47-year-old man who had been treated at Pyay General Hospital in Bago Region and a 63-year-old woman who had diabetes as an underlying illness.</p>
				<br>
				<p>On April 12, an 85-year-old COVID-19 patient with underlying hypertension, diabetes and heart disease died while in isolation at Yangon General Hospital.</p>
				<br>
				<p>As of Saturday, Myanmar had reported a total of 94 COVID-19 cases. The MOHS said two of the surviving patients are in intensive care at Waibargi Hospital, and the remainder are in stable condition.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Yangon has the country’s most serious coronavirus outbreak, with 76 COVID-19 patients and four deaths reported as of Saturday. On Friday, the Yangon regional government ordered a nighttime curfew to take effect Saturday. Residents of the region’s 44 townships except the Coco Islands are prohibited from going outdoors between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.</p>
				<br>
				<p>On Thursday, the MOHS ordered a conditional nationwide ban on gatherings of more than five people to control the spread of the disease.</p>
				<br>
				<p>As an additional measure, the MOHS on Saturday issued a conditional stay-home order covering seven Yangon townships where cases have been reported: Insein, Shwephyithar, Mayangone, Bahan, Pabalden, South Oakkalar and Hlaingtharyar.</p>
				<br>
				<p>The order excludes factory workers, company staff and government employees.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Under the order, only one person from each household is allowed to go shopping. In households with health issues, people may leave in pairs to go to a clinic or hospital. People must wear masks when they go out.</p>
				<br>
				<p>People who need to go out in groups of more than two may request permission to do so from their neighborhood authorities.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Anyone who fails to follow the instructions will be subject to legal action under the Prevention and Control of Communicable Disease Law, the MOHS said.</p>
