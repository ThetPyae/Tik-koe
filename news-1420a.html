				<p>To connect with the Myanmar public effectively amid the fight against coronavirus, State Counselor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi said she would start using Facebook, the dominant social media platform in Myanmar.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Her first post in Burmese on Wednesday said she “did not intend to use Facebook but now [I] will use this to be able to communicate quickly and effectively with the people regarding COVID-19 challenges.”</p>
				<br>
				<p>It’s not yet clear whether she will personally manage the page or not. As there was a misspelled “CORVID-19” in the post, which was later corrected, management of the page may be someone else’s responsibility.</p>
				<br>
				<p>On Wednesday, State Counselor Office Director General U Zaw Htay shared Aung San Suu Kyi’s page on his Facebook, saying “This is the State Counsellor’s official Facebook Account, created in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic.”</p>
				<br>
				<p>According to the Aung San Suu Kyi page, it was created in April 2016 and she posted her first profile picture on Tuesday evening.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Myanmar so far has 15 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including one patient who was suffering from nasal cancer and died on Tuesday.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Daw Aung San Suu Kyi has addressed the public three times since March 16, days before Myanmar confirmed its first cases of coronavirus, to discuss her government’s efforts in the fight against the pandemic.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Myanmar President Office spokesperson U Zaw Htay dismissed rumors on social media that the president and State Counsellor have been self-quarantining, as they have not been seen in public for a while.</p>
				<br>
				<p>U Zaw Htay said on Tuesday that both President U Win Myint and State Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi are in good health and serving their duties to the state amid the COVID-19 crisis.</p>
				<br>
				<p>“They are in good health and they are in neither self-quarantine nor home quarantine,” he said.</p>
				<br>
				<p>But he added, as COVID-19 is spreading in Myanmar, the country’s leaders are cautious about receiving guests and meeting with diplomats.</p>
				<br>
				<p>U Zaw Htay said the State Counsellor did not meet with the UN staff member who tested positive for COVID-19, now receiving treatment at Naypyitaw’s 1,000-bed hospital. The State Counsellor did meet with UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator Ola Almgren on March 23.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Since Myanmar confirmed its first case of COVID-19 on March 23, the State Counsellor has addressed the nation three times, most recently on Tuesday evening. The president has not appeared in public since early last month.</p>
