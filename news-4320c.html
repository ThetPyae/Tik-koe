				<h3>11 Factories in Myanmar Close Due to Lack of Orders, Raw Materials</h3>

				<p>Thirteen factories in Yangon and Bago regions have closed or cut back staff in Myanmar since January due to factors like a lack of raw materials, no orders and no buyers, according to the Ministry of Labor’s factories inspection department.</p>
				<br>
				<p>U Nyunt Win, director general of the department, told The Irrawaddy on Wednesday that seven factories had closed permanently, four had shut temporarily and two had reduced their workforces.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Most are garment factories, with the others making shoes, steel, wood, paper and printed goods.</p>
				<br>
				<p>The Labor Ministry declined to name the factories.</p>
				<br>
				<p>”The factory closures were due to loss of business, lack of orders and lack of raw materials,” said U Nyunt Win.</p>
				<br>
				<p>He said some of the factories faced challenges like industrial action and labor disputes. As a result, businesses lost partners, as they could not supply products on time.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Due to the factory closures, more than 3,000 workers were now unemployed. The shutdowns were not all linked to the coronavirus, according to the director-general.</p>
				<br>
				<p>The Union of Myanmar Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry (UMFCCI) said clothing factories were facing a shortage of supplies from China because of COVID-19.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Many factories were planning to lay off staff or stop operations if they faced long-term shortages of supplies, according to the trade organization.</p>
				<br>
				<p>The UMFCCI requested that the government allow employers to compensate workers based on the minimum daily wage of 4,800 kyats (US$3.4)—not their current salaries—if they close a factory.</p>
				<br>
				<p>It also requested the government suspend enforcing the new minimum wage until September rather than in May, as previously planned.</p>
				<br>
				<p>The federation called on banks to increase lending at low-interest rates to factories dealing with the coronavirus.</p>
				<br>
				<p>It also called on the government to prevent a planned strike for those factories that might have to close.</p>
				<br>
				<p>The Myanmar Garment Manufacturers Association (MGMG) vice-chairman U Aung Win this week said 20 clothing factories had threatened to close.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Meanwhile, 10 labor organizations, including trade unions and labor rights groups, on Tuesday issued a joint statement saying that some of the factories were closing to break unions and using the coronavirus as an excuse.</p>
				<br>
				<p>It called on the government to inspect factory closures because some had already reopened with new employees after officially closing down, allegedly because of the coronavirus.</p>
				<br>
				<p>“We do not argue if factory closures are really linked to a lack of supplies,” said Ko Nay Lin Aung, assistant secretary of the Myanmar Industry Crafts and Services Trade Union Federation.</p>
				<br>
				<p>He told The Irrawaddy that the Labor Ministry needed to pass legislation to prevent employers from closing factories under the pretext of the coronavirus.</p>
				<br>
				<p>A labor activist said the Lucky Sky bag factory in Hlaing Tharyar Township had already restarted operations with new staff after closing on Feb. 24 and blaming the coronavirus.</p>
				<br>
				<p>On Feb. 29, the Hua Meng garment factory in Ayeyarwady Region’s Pathein Township closed and sacked 1,000 workers because of what it said was a lack of supplies.</p>
				<br>
				<p>However, the Labor Ministry had not recognized the closure because employment disputes were ongoing with the company, a ministry official said.</p>
