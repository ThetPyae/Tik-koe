				<p>The total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Myanmar surged to 111 late Sunday, with more than half of the cases traced to religious gatherings hosted by two Christian pastors in Yangon.</p>
				<br>
				<p>The Ministry of Health and Sports (MOHS) confirmed 17 new cases in the past 24 hours, among them are nine people linked to the religious gatherings in Yangon.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Of the 111 total cases, 54 cases are related to religious gatherings, according to the latest MOHS situation report and Yangon regional lawmakers.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Last week, Myanmar police filed cases against two Christian pastors and two of their followers for breaching the government’s COVID-19 control directives after they held religious gatherings and some of their followers, including one of the country’s most famous rock stars, tested positive for the disease.</p>
				<br>
				<p>MOHS found that a total of 274 people related to the religious group had come into close contact with one another.</p>
				<br>
				<p>According MOHS, a 78-year-old man who died of COVID-19 on Saturday morning had close contact with a member of the religious group who previously tested positive for the disease.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Among the new confirmed cases is a one-and-a-half-year-old kid from Yangon’s Pabedan Township who had close contact with a patient who previously tested positive for the coronavirus.</p>
				<br>
				<p>A 60-year-old man and 54-year-old woman in Yangon’s North Dagon Township who cooked for a religious gathering tested positive on Sunday. Other confirmed cases in Yangon that were traced to the religious gatherings include a 42-year-old man from South Okkalapa Township, a 38-year-old man from Dawbon, a 43-year-old woman in Mingaladon, a 63-year-old man from Botahtaung and three women, ages 20, 44 and 85, from Mayangone.</p>
				<br>
				<p>“We have already placed all the people who had contact with the religious group in designated quarantine centers,” U Yan Shin, a lawmaker from Mayangone, told The Irrawaddy on Monday. “We are strictly controlling these people’s movement since our township is included in a conditional stay-at-home order.”</p>
				<br>
				<p>MOHS announced a conditional stay-at-home order on Saturday covering seven Yangon townships where cases have been reported: Insein, Shwephyithar, Mayangone, Bahan, Pabedan, South Okkala and Hlaingtharyar.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Yangon has most of the country’s coronavirus cases, with a total of 90 COVID-19 patients including 4 deaths.</p>
				<br>
				<p>The Yangon regional government has ordered a nighttime curfew that took effect on Saturday. Residents of the region’s 44 townships, except the Coco Islands, are prohibited from going outdoors between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m. On Thursday, MOHS ordered a conditional nationwide ban on gatherings of more than five people to control the spread of the disease. The order excludes factory workers, company staff and government employees.</p>
				<br>
				<p>According to the MOHS, seven people are recovering from COVID-19 as each of them has tested negative for the disease twice in follow-up lab tests. Among them are two patients from Mandalay and Naypyitaw who are already discharged from the hospital.</p>
				<br>
				<p>MOHS said Myanmar has tested a total of 4,786 people who are suspected of COVID-19 as of Sunday.</p>
