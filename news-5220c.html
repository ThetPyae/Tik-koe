				<h3>Gambling Hub Macau to Shut Casinos for Two Weeks Amid Virus Outbreak</h3>

				<p>The casino city of Macau will halt all casino operations for two weeks, leader Ho Iat Seng said Tuesday, a step aimed at stopping the spread of a new coronavirus outbreak in the world's largest gambling hub.</p>
				<br>
				<p>The move was prompted by the diagnosis the same day with the virus of a 29-year-old local woman, a hotel worker, who had been using shuttle buses used by casino industry workers.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Secretary for Economy and Finance Lei Wai Nong said in a statement that by midnight Tuesday, all 41 casinos and other premises, including movie theatres, pubs and nightclubs, will suspend operation for 15 days.</p>
				<br>
				<p>The area's six major casino operators have also promised the government that they will continue to pay their employees during the suspension, to show their social responsibility.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Macau reported two new cases on Tuesday, including the woman's, bringing the total in the Chinese territory to 10.</p>
				<br>
				<p>The woman had access to "casino shuttle buses and staff canteen, which is most worrying as other casino workers would also use the buses," Ho told reporters in Macau.</p>
				<br>
				<p>"This is a tough decision to make, but the health of Macau people is our only goal. For now, we can still bear the economic loss," he said.</p>
				<br>
				<p>The Macau leader said a decision will be made immediately on resuming casino operations after two weeks if the situation has stabilized.</p>
				<br>
				<p>The territory's civil servants have been given another week of leave following Thursday's end of a weeklong Lunar New Year holiday. During this period, only urgent public services are being maintained.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Ho urged the residents of the former Portuguese colony not to leave home unless necessary. "Heed us. Stay home unless you really need to go out."</p>
				<br>
				<p>Until now, the Macau government has taken a series of preventive measures, including requiring casino patrons and workers, and commuters on public transport to wear masks.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Macao opened its casino sector in 2002, ending a monopoly system over it. Its casino-related revenue exceeded that of Las Vegas in 2006, making it the world's largest gambling hub.</p>
				<br>
				<p>The gaming industry, the territory's major economic engine, brought 293 billion patacas ($37 billion) in revenue to Macau in 2019.</p>
