				<p>Myanmar reported its first confirmed cases of coronavirus in two men who had recently travelled to the United States and the United Kingdom.</p>
				<br>
				<p>The Southeast Asian nation had been the most populous country in the world to say it had no cases, despite sharing a long and porous border with China, where the virus originated in the city of Wuhan.</p>
				<br>
				<p>The health ministry said a 36-year-old travelling from the United States and 26-year-old returning from Britain, both Myanmar nationals, had tested positive.</p>
				<br>
				<p>“Investigation is ongoing on history of people who have been in contact with these two patients,” it said in a statement late on Monday.</p>
				<br>
				<p>The news of the confirmed cases sparked panic buying in the commercial capital of Yangon, with shoppers packing major supermarkets.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Myanmar last week closed land borders and banned mass gatherings, including for the upcoming Buddhist New Year. Cinemas have been closed, though bars and restaurants remain open.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Government spokesman Zaw Htay told a news conference earlier this month that the “lifestyle and diet of Myanmar citizens” had protected the country against the virus, while others credited the country’s Buddhist religion.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Some doctors say they fear a major outbreak though in a country with a health system ranked among the world’s worst after decades of neglect under military rule. Many services are run by volunteers and aid groups.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Two doctors told Reuters a likely explanation for the lack of cases in Myanmar was limited testing. Myanmar had carried out around 300 tests as of Monday evening, in a population of 51 million, according to health ministry spokeswoman Khin Khin Gyi.</p>
				<br>
				<p>“WHO has said, ‘test, test, test,” she said. “But who should we test? It has said specifically that we should test the suspected cases… We don’t test random people.”</p>
				<br>
				<p>Until recently, each test had to be approved by a central committee based in the capital of Naypyitaw, she said.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Thousands of migrant workers have returned to villages across the country in recent days from Thailand, which has confirmed hundreds of cases, raising fears of further spread of the virus.</p>
				<br>
				<p>“If these people have the virus, and it spreads widely, the situation will be very bad,” said Kyaw Ko Ko, a community worker from the city of Meiktila. “All we can do is sit and wait to collect all the dead bodies.”</p>
