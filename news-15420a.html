				<p>The governor of the northern Brazilian state of Pará, Helder Barbalho, says he has tested positive for coronavirus.</p>
				<br>
				<p>He tweeted the news shortly after the Rio state Governor Wilson Witzel said that he had contracted the virus.</p>
				<br>
				<p>They called on people to respect the restrictions of movement imposed by their states to curb the spread of the virus.</p>
				<br>
				<p>The lockdown has been criticised by President Jair Bolsonaro, who says the outbreak has been exaggerated.</p>
				<br>
				<p>"I ask you once again to stay at home. As everyone can tell, the disease doesn't make exceptions for anyone and the contagion is fast," Governor Witzel said in a message he posted on Twitter.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Mr Witzel said he had the symptoms associated with coronavirus such as fever, sore throat and loss of smell but that he would continue working for the people of his state.</p>
				<br>
				<p>The governor and President Bolsonaro have clashed over their different approaches to the pandemic.</p>
				<br>
				<p>The president has compared the virus to "a little flu" and panned social distancing measures, arguing they wreck Brazil's economy.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Mr Witzel said the president's defiance of guidelines from the United Nations and World Health Organization could be considered a "crime against humanity".</p>
				<br>
				<p>Mr Bolsonaro in turn accused the governor of acting like a dictator when Mr Witzel ordered Rio's popular beaches to close ahead of the Easter holidays.</p>
				<br>
				<p>"Beaches are outdoors. There's no problem going there at all," the president said on 2 April.</p>
				<br>
				<p>While the northern state of Pará has not been as badly affected as Rio, Governor Barbalho, also had a clear message for the residents. Wearing a face mask he said: "Those who love, care, and those who care, stay at home."</p>
				<br>
				<p>There are more than 25,000 confirmed cases in Brazil but a study published on Monday by a number of Brazilian universities and institutes suggests that the country is likely to have 12 times more cases of coronavirus than the number being reported by the government.</p>
				<br>
				<p>It estimated that only 8% of cases are being officially reported.</p>
				<br>
				<p>On Sunday, Rio's Christ the Redeemer statue was illuminated in a tribute to the healthcare workers fighting the pandemic.</p>
