				<br>
				<p>Ekiti Syaye governor and NGF Chairman, Kayode Fayemi, said the action had been necessitated by the increasing evidence of community transmission of the virus.</p>

				<br>
				<p>“The governors resolved to work with the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) to ensure that health workers are adequately provided with personal protective equipment (PPE) and are constantly trained on the use of protective gears.</p>
				<br>
				<p>“In order to strengthen coordinated implementation of necessary public health recommendations across states, Governors resolved to set up COVID-19 Committees at the regional level, headed by their State Commissioners of Health.</p>
				<br>
				<p>“Regional Committees will continue to interface with the State Task Force Committees on COVID-19 already established in each state.</p>
				<br>
				<p>“The Forum also received briefing from the Governors of Lagos, Bauchi, Oyo and Ogun states who shared their experiences and lessons from the fight against COVID-19.</p>
				<br>
				<p>“Governors unanimously agreed to the implementation of an inter-state lockdown in the country over the next two weeks to mitigate spread of the virus from State to State. Only essential services will be permitted.”</p>
				<br>
				<p>25 states have so far recorded cases along with the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja. Some of the uninfected states include Yobe, Benue, Taraba, Bayelsa and Plateau.</p>
