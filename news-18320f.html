				<p>Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced sweeping new measures on Wednesday, including discouraging travel overseas.</p>
				<br>
				<p>But he said schools, public transport and public squares would remain open, avoiding the kind of shutdown seen in some nations.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Australia has recorded over 450 positive tests and five deaths, with a sharp rise in cases in the past week.</p>
				<br>
				<p>However, the numbers remain lower than in Europe and North America.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Following a meeting of cabinet officials on Tuesday night, Mr Morrison said the government had declared a "biosecurity emergency". He described it as a "one in a hundred-year event" but urged the public to remain calm.</p>
				<br>
				<p>"We haven't seen this sort of thing in Australia since the end of the First World War. But together, we are up to this challenge," he said.</p>
				<br>
				<p>As part of the new restrictions, workplaces, prisons and other "essential" places will still operate as normal.</p>
				<br>
				<p>However, other events such as religious gatherings of more than 100 people and concerts in small venues will be prohibited.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Mr Morrison said Australians should not travel abroad anywhere - the first time such advice had been given in the nation's history.</p>
				<br>
				<p>"The biggest risk we have had and the biggest incidents of cases we have had... has been from Australians returning from overseas," he said.</p>
				<br>
				<p>On Sunday, Canberra ordered 14-day self-isolation for anyone arriving in the country. Australians currently abroad have been urged to return.</p>
				<br>
				<p><b>Keep away from each other'</b></p>
				<br>
				<p>The doubling of Australian case numbers in the past week has sparked public concern, increasing debate about whether schools and other places should shut.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Many office workers have also begun working from home as Australians practice social distancing measures.</p>
				<br>
				<p>While public health officials have encouraged this, they say they are not looking yet to implement more stringent lockdowns - predicting that the crisis could last about six months.</p>
				<br>
				<p>"There is no way that we can lock down society and make everyone stay home and then in a month's time, undo that, because the virus will just flare up again without any real long-term benefit," Australia's chief medical officer, Dr Brendan Murphy, told reporters.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Instead, he urged Australians to exercise caution in social interactions: "Keep away from each other where possible."</p>
				<br>
				<p>Dr Murphy also said the recent escalation in cases was "obviously concerning" but noted they were "largely still fuelled by imported cases".</p>
