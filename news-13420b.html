				<h3>Canadian care homes become coronavirus hotspots</h3>

				<p>Nearly half of the known coronavirus deaths in Canada are linked to outbreaks in elderly care facilities, public health officials say.</p>
				<br>
				<p>The disclosure comes as care homes across the country have come under scrutiny.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Over the weekend, a care home in the province of Quebec, where 31 people have died, was placed under investigation.</p>
				<br>
				<p>There are about 24,804 cases of the virus in Canada and 734 deaths to date.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Long-term care facilities are "driving the severe outcomes in Canada", said the federal chief public health officer Theresa Tam on Monday.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Dr Tam said all jurisdictions are trying to deal with outbreaks in both private and public seniors' facilities.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Where officials have data on whether a Covid-19 victim was in a care facility or seniors' residence, she said, "close to half" were linked to those establishments.</p>
				<br>
				<p><b>Quebec inquiry opened</b></p>
				<br>
				<p>On Sunday, the Quebec coroner's office launched an inquiry into deaths at private residential long-term care facility Residence Herron. Public health and police investigations are also underway.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Thirty-one of the home's residents have died since 13 March - at least five from the virus. The cause of death in the other 26 cases has not been established.</p>
				<br>
				<p>The home in Dorval, a Montreal suburb, has 150 residents. Authorities have stepped in to care for the residents.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Many staff had left the home amid "serious problems", he said during a weekend media briefing.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Its management company did not respond to a request from the BBC for comment but in a statement to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, said its appeals for help at the outbreak of the crisis went ignored by regional health officials.</p>
				<br>
				<p>The coroner's office said it is not currently investigating deaths at similar facilities in the province but is monitoring the situation closely.</p>
				<br>
				<p>The Quebec premier was more reassuring on Monday, saying provincial health officials are carrying out checks at all the province's long-term care homes - and in the majority of homes so far, patients were well treated and cared for.</p>
				<br>
				<p>He said it has long been a challenge to properly staff homes where workers are often paid low wages.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Some care home workers in Canada have staged protests over a lack of personal protective equipment available to them.</p>
				<br>
				<p>On Saturday, the federal government issues new guidelines to help homes prevent and contain contagion among residents.</p>
