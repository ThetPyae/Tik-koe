				<h3>Coronavirus: Some states begin to reopen as US death toll passes 50,000</h3>

				<p>Three US states have allowed some shops to reopen after measures imposed to curb the spread of the coronavirus, as the country's death toll passed 51,000.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Salons and spas could reopen in Georgia and Oklahoma while Alaska lifted restrictions on restaurants.</p>
				<br>
				<p>On Friday, President Donald Trump walked out of a shorter than usual briefing, refusing to take questions.</p>
				<br>
				<p>He has faced criticism after suggesting that disinfectant could potentially be used to treat the virus.</p>
				<br>
				<p>His remarks have been condemned as dangerous by doctors and manufacturers. Disinfectants are hazardous substances and can be poisonous if ingested, and even external exposure can be dangerous to the skin, eyes and respiratory system.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Mr Trump said on Friday that the comments - made at a news conference one day earlier - were sarcastic and taken out of context.</p>
				<br>
				<p><b>What is happening in the three states?</b></p>
				<br>
				<p>Customers visiting the newly reopened businesses in Georgia, Oklahoma and Alaska will be expected to continue adhering to social distancing measures. But some cities and areas have decided to keep their lockdowns in place.</p>
				<br>
				<p>In Georgia, which has one of the fastest reopening timetables in the country, bowling alleys, spas, hair and nail salons, tattoo parlours and other personal care businesses will be allowed to resume operations. On Monday, dine-in restaurants and theatres will be allowed to re-open.</p>
				<br>
				<p><b>What are the US numbers?</b></p>
				<br>
				<p>The US has by far the highest death toll and case count in the world - more than 50,000 deaths and 890,000 confirmed cases.</p>
				<br>
				<p>But European countries, including Spain and Italy, have recorded more deaths per capita than the US which has a population of 330 million.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Recent steep rises in the daily US death toll are also partly due to the inclusion of "probable" virus deaths - on 14 April, the US Centers for Disease Control said their case counts would include both confirmed and probable cases and deaths.</p>
				<br>
				<p>A probable Covid-19 death is one that meets clinical and epidemiological criteria but has not been confirmed by testing.</p>
				<br>
				<p>It is also important to note that many mild cases remain unreported, so the death rate from confirmed cases is not the same as the disease's overall death rate.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Testing efforts are key to tracking the actual mortality and spread of the disease. Vice-President Mike Pence, the Covid-19 taskforce leader, said the US had conducted 4.9 million tests thus far, and that the government was working with governors to expand testing.</p>
