				<p>US actor Tom Hanks has written a letter and sent a Corona-brand typewriter gift to an Australian boy who said he was bullied because of his name - Corona.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Corona De Vries, 8, first wrote to the Toy Story actor and his wife Rita Wilson after they fell sick with the virus in Queensland.</p>
				<br>
				<p>"I heard on the news you and your wife had caught the coronavirus," the boy wrote. "Are you OK?"</p>
				<br>
				<p>He added that he loved his name but was being called "coronavirus" at school.</p>
				<br>
				<p>"I get very sad and angry when people call me this," he wrote.</p>
				<br>
				<p>In response, Hanks replied with a letter that began: "Dear Friend Corona".</p>
				<br>
				<p>"Your letter made my wife and I feel so wonderful! Thank you for being such a good friend - friends make friends feel good when they are down."</p>
				<br>
				<p>Hanks and Wilson are both back in the US after spending about three weeks recovering from the virus on the Gold Coast in March.</p>
				<br>
				<p>The Oscar-winning actor told the boy: "You are the only person I've ever known to have the name Corona - like the ring around the sun, a crown."</p>
				<br>
				<p>He also sent a Corona-brand typewriter, which he had used during his quarantine in the city.</p>
				<br>
				<p>"I thought this typewriter would suit you," he said. "I had taken it to the Gold Coast, and now, it is back - with you. Ask a grown up how it works. And use it to write me back."</p>
				<br>
				<p>The De Vries family told Australian media outlet Nine News , who helped Corona convey his letter to Tom Hanks, that the boy was excited to get a "new friend in the US".</p>
				<br>
				<p>Corona reached out to Hanks because of his role as Woody in the Toy Story films, his family said.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Hanks had hand-written at the end of the letter: "PS! You got a friend in ME!" - a reference to the popular film's theme song.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Last month, the Hollywood couple travelled to Australia where Wilson gave a series of concerts and Hanks started filming an Elvis Presley biopic directed by Baz Luhrmann.</p>
				<br>
				<p>It's thought the couple may have contracted the virus in the US or while travelling to Australia.</p>
