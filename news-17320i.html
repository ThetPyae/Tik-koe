				<h3>Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson released from coronavirus treatment</h3>

				<p>The couple, who are now in self-quarantine in their Queensland rented home, announced they had tested positive last week.</p>
				<br>
				<p>The couple were on the Gold Coast as Hanks made a film about Elvis Presley. Production has been put on hold.</p>
				<br>
				<p>There are currently 375 confirmed cases of the virus in Australia.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Hanks, 63, said last Thursday on Instagram he had come down with the virus.</p>
				<br>
				<p>"We felt a bit tired, like we had colds and some body aches. Rita had some chills that came and went. Slight fevers too," he said in a post.</p>
				<br>
				<p>He later followed up with another post, thanking "everyone here Down Under who are taking such good care of us".</p>
				<br>
				<p>The Oscar-winning actor is not the only celebrity to have tested positive for the virus. British actor Idris Elba on Monday revealed he had tested positive.</p>
				<br>
				<p>"I feel ok, I have no symptoms so far. No panic," he said in a tweet.</p>
				<br>
				<p>He was tested because he was "exposed" to someone who had tested positive, he said. He has been self-isolating since Friday.</p>
				<br>
				<p>"We live in a divided world, we all feel it...now's the time for solidarity," he added.</p>
				<br>
				<p>According to Australia's Department of Health, there are currently 68 confirmed cases in Queensland, where Hanks is located.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Australia's prime minister on Monday ordered a 14-day self-isolation period for anyone arriving in the country.</p>
				<br>
				<p>"We know that the virus cannot be absolutely stopped... but we can slow the spread," said Scott Morrison.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Foreign cruise liners will also be banned from docking in Australia for 30 days, but schools will remain open.</p>
				<br>
				<p>In February, more than 200 Australian nationals were flown home after 14 days in quarantine on remote Christmas Island.</p>
				<br>
				<p>They had been evacuated from China's Hubei province, where the outbreak emerged late last year.</p>
