				<p>Pubs, clubs, gyms, cinemas and places of worship will be shut from midday on Monday, while restaurants and cafes will have to switch to takeaway only.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced the restrictions after a national cabinet meeting.</p>
				<br>
				<p>The number of cases in Australia has risen sharply in recent days, reaching 1,315.</p>
				<br>
				<p>New South Wales (NSW), home to Sydney, is the worst-affected state with 533 confirmed cases. Victoria, of which Melbourne is the capital, has 296 cases, while Queensland has 259.</p>
				<br>
				<p>The new restrictions will see many businesses close but supermarkets, petrol stations, pharmacies and home delivery services will continue running.</p>
				<br>
				<p>The prime minister said he wanted to keep schools open but parents would be able to keep their children at home if they wished to do so.</p>
				<br>
				<p>"I don't want to see our children lose an entire year of their education," he said.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Some states, including Victoria, have signalled that they want to close schools.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Seven people have died across Australia so far from Covid-19.</p>
				<br>
				<p>The new measures come after large crowds gathered on Sydney's beaches including Bondi on Saturday, flouting social distancing advice.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Mr Morrison said that the federal and state governments had decided to act because Australians were not obeying guidelines.</p>
				<br>
				<p>But he added: "We are not putting in place lockdowns that put people in and confine them to their homes.</p>
				<br>
				<p>"That is not a measure that has been contemplated at this point."</p>
				<br>
				<p>Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy said people, especially the young, had to realise that they needed to live "very differently" and stop going out in order to control the virus.</p>
				<br>
				<p>In other developments:</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					<ul>
						<li>The prime minister announced new stimulus measures to boost the economy</li>
						<li>South Australia, Western Australia and the Northern Territory will close their borders from Tuesday. Under the new rules, anyone arriving will be forced to self-isolate for 14 days</li>
						<li>Tasmania, an island state, has already imposed similar travel restrictions</li>
						<li>The Australian Football League suspended its 2020 season, with no fixtures until at least 31 May. The women's league has also been halted</li>
						<li>In contrast, the National Rugby League says it will carry on with matches as planned</li>
