				<p>Apartment buildings where Myanmar’s latest COVID-19 patients lived are under quarantine after two men tested positive on Friday.</p>
				<br>
				<p>The country’s health ministry confirmed that a 69-year-old in Yangon and a 33-year-old in Mandalay had the disease. Both men recently arrived from overseas.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Myanmar reported its first case early this week and now has five confirmed COVID-19 cases.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Following the government’s announcement on Friday, an eight-story building in Yangon’s Mingalar Taung Nyunt Township has been put under 14-day quarantine.</p>
				<br>
				<p>The man arrived on March 14 from Australia, where he received a month’s medical treatment for nasal cancer. On his way home, he stopped in Singapore for four days. He suffered from a fever, cough and sore throat shortly after arriving in Yangon and was admitted to hospital for observation.</p>
				<br>
				<p>On Friday, the building and its grounds have been disinfected.</p>
				<br>
				<p>The township’s lawmaker, U Hla Htay, told The Irrawaddy that his daughter, nephew and drivers were under observation at the Waibargi Infectious Diseases Hospital in Yangon.</p>
				<br>
				<p>“Now we have assigned community volunteers to isolate the building and support those inside,” he said.</p>
				<br>
				<p>In Mandalay, the regional government has quarantined a building in Chanmyathazi Township.</p>
				<br>
				<p>The US citizen arrived on March 19 with Qatar Airways. He spent a night in Yangon before heading to Mandalay by bus.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Five of his relatives are under quarantine at Kandawnadi Hospital, according to the township’s lawmaker, U Myint Aung Moe.</p>
				<br>
				<p>He said about 80 people in the 18 apartments in the building were under quarantine and their health would be monitored.</p>
				<br>
				<p>“They all are now ordered to follow home quarantine and the authorities will make sure they stay at home. Daily health checks will be carried out,” said the lawmaker.</p>
				<br>
				<p>The man had a cough, sore throat and high temperature and was admitted to Mandalay General Hospital on March 25. He is now under isolation at Kandawnadi Hospital.</p>
				<br>
				<p>The hospital said the patient had swellings on his lungs but was in a stable condition.</p>
				<br>
				<p>The regional government asked everyone who had contact with him, including his taxi driver, bus driver and the passengers on his flight and bus, to report to a clinic.</p>
				<br>
				<p>So far Myanmar has cases in Yangon’s Wabagi hospital, Insein Hospital and Yangon General Hospital, one case in Mandalay Kandawnadi Hospital and another in Tedim Hospital in Chin State.</p>
				<br>
				<p>As of Thursday night, 20 people suspected of having the disease were under observation, according to the Ministry of Health and Sports.</p>
