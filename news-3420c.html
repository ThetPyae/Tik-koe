				<p>The four new COVID-19 cases confirmed in Myanmar on Thursday evening are the children, husband and niece of a previously confirmed patient.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Myanmar has 20 confirmed cases so far, according to the Ministry of Health and Sports (MOHS), of whom one died on Tuesday.</p>
				<br>
				<p>The four new cases are the daughter (aged 8), son (10), husband (47) and niece (18) of the 15th COVID-19 patient to be identified in the county. All four were admitted to Pauk Khaung Hospital in Bago Region after being in home quarantine since Tuesday. They were transferred to the Pyay General Hospital late on Thursday evening, according to parliamentarian U Thet Min Zaw.</p>
				<br>
				<p>As the husband is a Pauk Khaung township administrator, two staff who work with him have been placed in the quarantine center, said U Thet Min Zaw. Although locals are concerned, he said the authorities have disinfected the home of all COVID-19 patients and put the surrounding areas in semi-lockdown.</p>
				<br>
				<p>The husband took the children from their home in Yangon’s Bahan Township to Pauk Khaung last Friday after his wife fell sick.</p>
				<br>
				<p>She tested positive for COVID-19 on Tuesday.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Four lawmakers representing Bago’s Pauk Khaung constituency, including U Thet Min Zaw, have voluntarily placed themselves under home quarantine after they were in contact with the husband.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Tens of thousands of people, including healthcare workers, across Myanmar who had close contact with the confirmed cases are now in quarantine. Twenty-two out of 25 health workers who were quarantined for a 14-day period that ended on Thursday tested negative, Daw Khin Khin Gyi, the director of the Central Contagious Disease Prevention and Eradication Sub-Department at the MOHS, said on Friday. But 17 more healthcare workers related to the 16th case have been quarantined, as the patient was not truthful about her travel history.</p>
