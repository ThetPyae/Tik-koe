				<p><b>Children up to the age of 11 are returning to nurseries and schools across Denmark, as the government becomes the first in Europe to relax coronavirus restrictions on education.</b></p>
				<br>
				<p>Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen welcomed children as they went back to school in the capital Copenhagen.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Denmark was among the first countries in Europe to impose a lockdown, with schools closed on 12 March.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Infection rates have been low but critics warn the strategy is risky.</p>
				<br>
				<p>"We're all a bit nervous and we'll have to ensure that we stick to hygiene rules," Elisa Rimpler of the BUPL, the Danish Union of Early Childhood and Youth Educators, told the BBC.</p>
				<br>
				<p>"We have a lot of washing hands during the day. We don't have masks and we have to keep a good distance from each other so that's a very difficult task."</p>
				<br>
				<p>Denmark's move came as European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen set out a roadmap on Wednesday for a gradual lifting of restrictions across the 27-state bloc, but made clear it was not a signal to act immediately.</p>
				<br>
				<p>She set out key conditions involving a significant decrease in the spread of Covid-19, capacity in the health system, surveillance and monitoring. A donors' conference will take place online for governments and organisations to pledge money in search of a vaccine, Mrs von der Leyen added.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Other countries besides Denmark have moved to relax lockdown measures this week:</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					<ul>
						<li>Austria reopened thousands of smaller shops on Tuesday and has said it will allow outdoor sport such as tennis, golf and athletics from 1 May</li>
						<li>The Czech government has set out a five-stage timetable</li>
						<li>Spain has allowed non-essential workers to go back to work after a two-week pause</li>
						<li>Italian bookshops and clothing stores for youngsters have reopened their doors in some regions</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>German Chancellor Angela Merkel will discuss easing restrictions with the country's 16 state premiers on Wednesday, with reports that they are expected to agree to a limited reopening of shops from next Monday and a relaxation of rules on movement from 3 May.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Spain reported another 523 deaths on Wednesday and a 3% increase in infections but officials said the rise in new cases may have been due to a delay in reporting because of the Easter break.</p>
				<br>
				<p>In Russia, veterans' groups have appealed to President Vladimir Putin to cancel the 9 May military victory parade marking the 75th anniversary of the end of World War Two. Kremlin officials have indicated the event could be held at a later date.</p>
